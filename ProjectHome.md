I grew up playing video games. When I was learning java in college, Sun Microsystems and Paradox Studios threw a J2ME game dev contest, I took the opportunity to build a game then. Its cool, check out this [demo video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO9q-UromWo).

Prebuilt jar can be downloaded from [here](http://code.google.com/p/rickshawrage/downloads/list). In order to run the game, your phone has to support CLDC-1.1 and MIDP-2.0. Also, its optimized for the screen size 176 X 208 px

The Build:
If you have any interest in rebuilding the game. At the time, when I wrote it, I was not familiar with IDEs/ANT and I simply used Sun Java WTK. So, the easiest way would be to use WTK :).

**Disclaimer:** Pretty much all the graphics work used in this game was provided by Paradox studios and Sun Microsystems. To the best of my knowledge I'm not violating any copyrights. If someone has any issues with the graphics used in this game, let me know and I'll replace them.
